            Every 4 years presidential candidates in the United States start a long race to win the presidency through elections, however, elections are unpredictable and a lot can happen in 4 years that would influence how the next election will play out.
            Using different county-level datasets regarding county income, county population, county area, and election votes from the U.S. Census estimates, I would like to explore these variables, that are believed to be influential to election votes, on a national county-level to see how much do they affect Republican/Democratic votes distribution in the 2016 elections.
